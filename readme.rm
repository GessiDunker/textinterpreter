# Text Interpreter

This Python library provides tools for analyzing and interpreting text data. It includes functions for:

* Tokenization: splitting text into words or sentences
* Part-of-speech tagging: identifying the grammatical role of each word
* Named entity recognition: identifying named entities such as people, places, and organizations
* Sentiment analysis: determining the overall sentiment of a text
* Topic modeling: identifying the main topics in a collection of texts

## Installation

To install the library, simply run the following command:

```
pip install textinterpreter
```

## Usage

The library can be used to analyze text data in a variety of ways. For example, the following code snippet tokenizes a sentence and prints the resulting list of words:

```python
from textinterpreter import tokenize

text = "This is a sample sentence."
tokens = tokenize(text)
print(tokens)
```

Output:

```
['This', 'is', 'a', 'sample', 'sentence', '.']
```
